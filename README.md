## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this project I reinforced some of my knowledge of CSS and brushed up on my abilities.

Pretty proud of this particular snippet

```css
.card {
    align-items: center;
    background-color: white;
    border-radius: 1rem;
    box-shadow: 0 0 20px 5px lightgray;
    justify-content: center;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    margin: 2rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    width: 320px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to work on adding these kinds of elements to full web pages, or implementing it as a modal. I would also like to work on my design skills to build pleasing websites.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped with finding documentation of CSS elements.
